# Cloud-Deployed-T-Pot-Honeypot-Threat-Monitoring-Analysis
Deployed a cloud-based T-Pot honeypot to observe and document real-world attack attempts. Captured unauthorized access attempts and analyzed common attack patterns against exposed services.

# Overview

This project documents the deployment of a public-facing T-Pot multi-honeypot platform in a cloud environment to capture and analyze real-world malicious traffic.

The goal was to simulate an exposed internet host, observe attacker behavior, and analyze common threat patterns such as brute-force attempts and automated scanning.


# Objectives

- Deploy T-Pot on a cloud VPS

- Expose the server to the internet

- Capture real attack attempts

- Analyze basic attacker behavior


# Tools & Technologies

- T-Pot (Multi-honeypot platform)

- Ubuntu Linux (Cloud VPS)

- HTTPS Web Dashboard

- SSH
